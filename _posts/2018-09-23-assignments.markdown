I never quite know what to write in these assignments since I'm not really at a point to have something polished.  I've been working on my CLI project off and on, started from scratch at least 4 times and still havent gotten 100% to satisfaction.  Thankfully there was a CLI gem walkthrough video which was instrumental in helping to guide me through this first project.

School is a priority for me, but working full time and doing this part time is a bit tough for me.

I'll keep trying, I'm in this for the long haul.

Till the next assignment.
