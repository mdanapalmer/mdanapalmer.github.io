To path to getting here has been very non-linear.  Though if I were to really sit down and take a good, hard look at the interests I've had my entire life, coding would make so much sense.  A keen interest in video games, perfectionist, detail oriented, and a forever learner.

I have so many interests that when it came time to study at university I couldn't choose.  But I wanted to travel the world and see things, like you do.  So I chose Japanese as my major of focus.  In a sense, this has helped me to understand the process of learning that I've come to experience with coding.

Prior to being able to express myself in Japanese, I was better at interpreting it.  Living in Japan was an experience I will never forget.  I lived through the disasters of Fukushima and the Tohoku Earthquake (9.1) and Tsunami by being there in the moment, so in a very visceral way, Japan is a part of me.  I have many stories to tell there, but let's come back to the coding aspect.

Since then, I've wanted to contribute more to the world than simply enriching myself and my knowledge.  What I build here can also be used to assist others.  I've no interest in knowing every minute detail of who I may help, but just knowing that something I've created could help someone I don't even know is enough for me.

I decided to take a leap into an adventure once more, leaving the familiar and taking a dive into tech.  I've found I really like how tech is interconnected into everything I enjoy.  Outer Space, physics, chemistry, sciences, art, culture, language... each of these objects are touched by technology in some capacity, and it's a good feeling to fit into something that crosses so many professions and categories of study.

I hope to make a difference in someone's life.  And I hope to make you all proud, to feel supported and know that I believe that there are great things in our future.
