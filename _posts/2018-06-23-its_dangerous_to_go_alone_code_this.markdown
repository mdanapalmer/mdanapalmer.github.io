Test fails because it's expecting a falsey result that returned truthy. So I change the statement to reflect a falsey statement and test fails because it now expects a truthy result.

The only conclusion here is a null statement. Neither true nor false. It just is. (I have no idea what the answer to this question is except to laugh with sad tears.)

Everyone has their reasons, I don't think mine are anything special aside from an interest.  A combination of two things I enjoy and find to be deeper than I ever imagined it to be. Language and Computers.

From childhood, I've always been curious about things outside of my little bubble (in terms of my present location and also the world at large).  Because of this, I've made it a point to travel the world as often as I can.

Human language is just as complex as Machine language, the only difference I notice so far (in my humble experience) is that human language is more nuanced, more implication than a machine language.  

Even so, that doesn't mean that machine language is without its elegance and honesty.  An equation to describe the human observation of the universe is mathematical, and I feel so far that machine language is a clever blend of mathematics, logic, and imagination.

But how cool is it to talk to a computer?  I think it's pretty neat, to be honest.  Not just as a tool to facilitate the imagination, but also as a way to explore ideas that our ancestors didn't have the opportunity to.

One day I do want to be able to ask and answer the philosophical question: [Does this unit have a soul?](https://andphilosophy.com/2015/06/02/mass-effect-personal-identity-and-genocide/)

Humans tend to wonder if we are alone in the universe.  What if we make our friends by creating them right here?

This is all fancy and sappy.  Too idealist, perhaps.  But I wasn't sure what to write specifically since my reasons right now are a selfish desire to be a life-long learner.  I don't know if I'm making the right choice, but I reckon that if this is a mistake, it's one I can live with.

ad astra.
