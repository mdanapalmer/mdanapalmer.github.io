I'm still a long way from being independent in this adventure.  There have been tears and frustration, but thankfully at the end there has been progress.  I don't really know what to expect next.  sometimes I don't know when something needs to be added or what needs to be done.  I take pretty comprehensive notes and go over them, but sometimes the answers elude me.

They say there's often a positive bias to those who are beginners because they're unaware of their mistakes, so they often rate themselves very advanced in material.

The good news is that I know better than to rate my learning material against anything.  Nothing to write home about.

What is GitHub?

It's basically a giant library of code that other people have contributed to, and that you can, too.  It's also got the ability to dynamically change the flow of code so that you can work on something else while adding to it.  It's neat, I'm just a little overwhelmed by the SSH licensing bit.  Really tripped me up.  If I didn't have help, I'd be so lost.

Be a team player, help when you can, give back when you can.

Peace.

Addendum:

So I'm starting to understand the process of the yield keyword, though I am not sure as to why or how I would use this tool to implement my coding as of yet.  

As I currently understand it, yield essentially causes your flow of execution to the block of code (that can be defined outside of the method) to another block of code.  There's an image of a flow chart that helped me begin to understand the order of operation, so to speak.  It's here: https://mixandgo.com/learn/mastering-ruby-blocks-in-less-than-5-minutes  You'll want to check out the "How Yield Works" section.  

For some reason I keep thinking of it in terms of reduce, reuse, recycle, or at least the kind of three part process it's up to.  Right now I'm reliant on the arrows to kind of get an idea of what's going on.
