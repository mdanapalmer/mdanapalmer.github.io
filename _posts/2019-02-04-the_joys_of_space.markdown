I have had the luxury of working in a technical support team for the past nearly 3 years, so the CSS and HTML sections were a lot more fun than I had expected them to be.  I'm still quite the novice in terms of development of the design from scratch, but with time and practice that will come.

What I'm more enjoying is the architecture of a website and making all the pieces connect.  It's been a pleasure to spend hours, even if it's frustrating at times, to get things working appropriately and seeing how those connections are made.  Identification of errors from what's *not* happening is more of an art than one might expect.  It reminds me of how dark matter was observed to exist by being what's *not* expected.

The hardest part of my Sinatra portfolio project has been the edit function.  From passing values and making sure they prepopulate when you press that edit link (or button) is a right challenge, but one that is incredibly satisfying once completed.

I began my journey Saturday a couple of weeks ago, so this project took me 15 days overall to complete.  I've noticed I have a very hard time with remembering to commit, mainly because I am so excited and caught up in thinking of what comes next and where the information it moving.  I've got to practice to improve upon making those habits.  Ultimately I'd like to create a foundational reference to make sure I've got each and every piece of information for my foundation going without having to reference the VERY helpful videos that Avi and his students have made for us.

I must confess, I learned quite a lot in this case, and troubleshooted more than I ever thought possible.  Even though I was at my wits end, reading up on stack overflow and writing down the steps of what I want my actions to do helped a lot.  I must also commend my Sinatra technical coach, DJ, for helping me troubleshoot something that I never would have thought of doing.  I did actually learn from that experience that there's more than one way to query for data, using the same words.

Overall, I feel very good about this project, even though I know that it's rough around the edges and is more repetitive than I'd like it to be.  every route needs authentication on if the user is in fact logged in, several routes are redirecting to similar pages.  It goes against the grain of the DRY concept.  Hopefully that will not detract from my project when it comes time for review.

I haven't updated here in a long while.  Life has been unsteady for a long time due to several issues that I would like to discuss, but it's a bit personal.  Mainly related to my job (which makes me sad because I love tech, I love coding!  It's really invigorating for me).  Regardless, despite the troubles I have elsewhere in my life I've found that I can come to coding and distract my mind.  A welcome result.

Wish me luck on my project review.  I hope this time it goes more smoothly than my CLI project.  Many thanks to Nancy for helping me to retain, learn, and take constructive criticism bravely.  Onward and upward to the stars, my friends.  Of course my project is related to spacey things, are you surprised? :)

Cheers!

Dana
